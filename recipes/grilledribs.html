    <h4>Smoky and Tender BBQ Ribs</h4>
    <p>
      Nothing beats the rich, smoky flavor of perfectly cooked BBQ ribs.
      Slow-cooked to tender perfection and coated in a savory, tangy sauce,
      these ribs are a backyard favorite. Whether grilled over an open flame or
      baked low and slow in the oven, they develop a deep caramelized crust that
      locks in their juicy goodness.
